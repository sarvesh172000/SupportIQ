SupportIQ - RAG-Enabled Customer Support Data Pipeline
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze customer support tickets. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) for classification and sentiment analysis and implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to allow users to ask questions over historical ticket data.

🧩 Problem Statement
Customer support teams often struggle with high ticket volumes, answering repetitive questions, and a lack of actionable analytics. This project addresses these challenges by creating a data pipeline that:

Ingests support tickets from various sources.

Performs NLP-based classification and sentiment analysis.

Generates embeddings for semantic search and stores them in a vector database.

Enables users to ask questions over past tickets using a RAG-based assistant.

Provides dashboards for monitoring ticket trends, sentiment, and agent performance.

🧠 Approach & Key Features
The project is designed as a modular, end-to-end data engineering solution with the following stages:

Ingestion: Load data from CSVs, APIs, or real-time Kafka streams using scheduled workflows.

Processing: Clean, parse, and classify tickets at scale using PySpark.

RAG Setup: Generate vector embeddings from ticket data using LangChain for semantic understanding.

Storage: Store structured, processed data in Snowflake and vector embeddings in Pinecone.

Dashboard: Visualize key metrics like ticket volume, sentiment, and agent stats.

RAG Assistant: Provide a web UI to ask questions over the knowledge base of past tickets.

CI/CD & Deployment: Ensure a reproducible, automated, and deployable pipeline.

📍 Roadmap & Milestones (4 Weeks)
This project is planned to be completed over a 4-week timeline.

Week 1 – Ingestion & Cleaning
[✅] Set up GitHub repository and Docker environment.

[✅] Implement Airflow DAG to schedule CSV/API ingestion.

[✅] Develop PySpark jobs to clean and preprocess raw ticket data.

Week 2 – NLP Enrichment & Storage
[✅] Integrate sentiment analysis models (e.g., TextBlob/VADER).

[✅] Train or use a pre-trained model to classify ticket types.

[✅] Load cleaned, enriched data into Snowflake tables.

[✅] Create vector embeddings from tickets using LangChain.

Week 3 – RAG Assistant & Semantic Search
[✅] Build a FastAPI application to serve the RAG chatbot.

[✅] Connect the API to the Pinecone vector store for semantic search.

[✅] Implement logic for users to ask questions and receive answers from past tickets.

Week 4 – Dashboard & CI/CD
[✅] Develop a Power BI or Streamlit dashboard to visualize KPIs.

[✅] Dockerize all services (Airflow, Spark, API, Dashboard).

[✅] Implement a GitHub Actions workflow to build, test, and deploy the pipeline.

[✅] Deploy the full stack on a cloud VM (AWS EC2 or GCP).
